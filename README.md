# Design concept for OpenStreetMap Taiwan website
Since the drupal CMS needs a big renovatation, why don't scrap the plan and build a new one?

By massive 'copy and paste', Dada! 

Base on Material Design Lite (MDL), here's a new design for OSMTW.

花了一點時間生出來的東西依照 Material Design Lite (MDL) 「拼貼」而成，

基本上都是看著人家 Component 弄的，希望各位看官鞭小力一點啊
